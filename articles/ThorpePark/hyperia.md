It’s taken us a few days to really sum up May 24th where we found our fearless.

Honestly what a rollercoaster, from start to finish it is simply perfection. Hyperia is an astonishing rollercoaster, and we are so lucky to have a rollercoaster of that calibre in the UK. Hyperia is 236ft tall and reaches speeds of 80+ mph making it the tallest and fastest coaster in the UK with a worlds first element: an outer bank airtime hill.
We are so blown away by Hyperia and hope many other people can take flight as soon as she reopens.

But the real question is what could honestly top that in the UK?
